# AgriAllies 🌱  
*Connecting Farmers with Opportunity*

## 📌 Project Overview
AgriAllies is a social-impact agri-fintech platform designed to empower small-scale farmers by connecting them with accessible, low-interest micro-lending opportunities. The platform helps farmers invest in sustainable agricultural practices while offering investors a transparent and socially responsible way to support rural communities.

The project addresses key challenges faced by farmers such as limited access to affordable credit, rigid repayment systems, and lack of agricultural guidance. AgriAllies introduces a flexible, inclusive, and sustainability-focused financial ecosystem for agriculture.
